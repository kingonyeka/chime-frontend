        Regulation Make no mistake about it: you must choose a licensed online Forex trading site by a respected organisation. The majority of the platforms we use are regulated by the FCA (UK), CySEC (Cyprus), and/or ASIC (Australia). Finally, this assures that you can use our Telegram forex signals in a completely safe and secure atmosphere.

        Supported Pairs on Forex Signal Telegram While our Telegram Forex signals typically focus on major and minor pairs, this is not always the case. In contrast, our team of in-house traders frequently finds winning trades on less liquid pairs.

        Fees & Commissions As previously discussed in this course, we usually use a risk-to-reward ratio of 1:3. On the one hand, despite the fact that these improvements are minor, they can quickly add up over the period of one month.

        However, if you use a broker that does not offer competitive fees and commissions, your ability to maximize your profits will be limited. For example: Assume you invest $500 on one of our Telegram Forex signals. Your chosen broker charges a 1% commission, which equals $5 for placing the order. Our profit target of 3% was met, thus your $500 stake is now worth $515.

        You exit the position, paying a 1% commission totaling $5.15. As such, you paid This trade involved a commission of $10.15. According to what has been explained above, this makes the trade slightly unprofitable because you would have spent more on a commission than you actually earned. For this reason, we only advocate Forex trading systems that offer completely commission-free trading. The previous deal would have allowed you to keep the entire $15 profit created by our Telegram Forex signal. You should ensure that your chosen broker provides tight spreads in addition to commissions. This is an indirect cost that many beginning traders overlook. For those unfamiliar, the spread is simply the difference between the buy and sell prices of the currency pair supplied by your broker. In most cases, our suggested brokers have spreads of less than 1 pip for major pairs.

        It is also critical that you select a forex trading platform that provides a full-featured mobile app. If the broker offers this, it is usually compatible with both iOS and Android devices. We believe mobile trading apps are vital for our Telegram signal service because the forex market moves so quickly.
